### Responses

#### Provide resource (UU)IDs

Give each resource an `id` attribute by default. Use UUIDs unless you
have a very good reason not to. Don’t use IDs that won’t be globally
unique across instances of the service or other resources in the
service, especially auto-incrementing IDs.

Render UUIDs in downcased `8-4-4-4-12` format, e.g.:

```
"id": "01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef"
```

#### Provide standard timestamps

Provide `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps for resources by default,
e.g:

```javascript
{
  // ...
  "created_at": "2012-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2012-01-01T13:00:00Z",
  // ...
}
```

These timestamps may not make sense for some resources, in which case
they can be omitted.

#### Use UTC times formatted in ISO8601

Accept and return times in UTC only. Render times in ISO8601 format,
e.g.:

```
"finished_at": "2012-01-01T12:00:00Z"
```

#### Nest foreign key relations

Serialize foreign key references with a nested object, e.g.:

```javascript
{
  "name": "service-production",
  "owner": {
    "id": "5d8201b0..."
  },
  // ...
}
```

Instead of e.g:

```javascript
{
  "name": "service-production",
  "owner_id": "5d8201b0...",
  // ...
}
```

This approach makes it possible to inline more information about the
related resource without having to change the structure of the response
or introduce more top-level response fields, e.g.:

```javascript
{
  "name": "service-production",
  "owner": {
    "id": "5d8201b0...",
    "name": "Alice",
    "email": "alice@heroku.com"
  },
  // ...
}
```

#### Generate structured errors

Generate consistent, structured response bodies on errors. Include a
machine-readable error `id`, a human-readable error `message`, and
optionally a `url` pointing the client to further information about the
error and how to resolve it, e.g.:

```
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
```

```json
{
  "id":      "rate_limit",
  "message": "Account reached its API rate limit.",
  "url":     "https://docs.service.com/rate-limits"
}
```

Document your error format and the possible error `id`s that clients may
encounter.

#### Show rate limit status

Rate limit requests from clients to protect the health of the service
and maintain high service quality for other clients. You can use a
[token bucket algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket) to
quantify request limits.

Return the remaining number of request tokens with each request in the
`RateLimit-Remaining` response header.

#### Keep JSON minified in all responses

Extra whitespace adds needless response size to requests, and many
clients for human consumption will automatically "prettify" JSON
output. It is best to keep JSON responses minified e.g.:

```json
{"beta":false,"email":"alice@heroku.com","id":"01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef","last_login":"2012-01-01T12:00:00Z","created_at":"2012-01-01T12:00:00Z","updated_at":"2012-01-01T12:00:00Z"}
```

Instead of e.g.:

```json
{
  "beta": false,
  "email": "alice@heroku.com",
  "id": "01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef",
  "last_login": "2012-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "created_at": "2012-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2012-01-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

You may consider optionally providing a way for clients to retreive 
more verbose response, either via a query parameter (e.g. `?pretty=true`)
or via an `Accept` header param (e.g.
`Accept: application/vnd.heroku+json; version=3; indent=4;`).

### Artifacts

#### Provide machine-readable JSON schema

Provide a machine-readable schema to exactly specify your API. Use
[prmd](https://github.com/interagent/prmd) to manage your schema, and ensure
it validates with `prmd verify`.

#### Provide human-readable docs

Provide human-readable documentation that client developers can use to
understand your API.

If you create a schema with prmd as described above, you can easily
generate Markdown docs for all endpoints with with `prmd doc`.

In addition to endpoint details, provide an API overview with
information about:

* Authentication, including acquiring and using authentication tokens.
* API stability and versioning, including how to select the desired API
  version.
* Common request and response headers.
* Error serialization format.
* Examples of using the API with clients in different languages.

#### Provide executable examples

Provide executable examples that users can type directly into their
terminals to see working API calls. To the greatest extent possible,
these examples should be usable verbatim, to minimize the amount of
work a user needs to do to try the API, e.g.:

```bash
$ export TOKEN=... # acquire from dashboard
$ curl -is https://$TOKEN@service.com/users
```

If you use [prmd](https://github.com/interagent/prmd) to generate Markdown
docs, you will get examples for each endpoint for free.

#### Describe stability

Describe the stability of your API or its various endpoints according to
its maturity and stability, e.g. with prototype/development/production
flags.

See the [Heroku API compatibility policy](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/api-compatibility-policy)
for a possible stability and change management approach.

Once your API is declared production-ready and stable, do not make
backwards incompatible changes within that API version. If you need to
make backwards-incompatible changes, create a new API with an
incremented version number.
