#### Version with Accepts header

Version the API from the start. Use the `Accepts` header to communicate
the version, along with a custom content type, e.g.:

```
Accept: application/vnd.heroku+json; version=3
```

Prefer not to have a default version, instead requiring clients to
explicitly peg their usage to a specific version.
