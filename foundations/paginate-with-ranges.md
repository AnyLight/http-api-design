#### Paginate with Ranges

Paginate any responses that are liable to produce large amounts of data.
Use `Content-Range` headers to convey pagination requests. Follow the
example of the [Heroku Platform API on Ranges](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/platform-api-reference#ranges)
for the details of request and response headers, status codes, limits,
ordering, and page-walking.
