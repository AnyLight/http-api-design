### Requests

#### Return appropriate status codes

Return appropriate HTTP status codes with each response. Successful
responses should be coded according to this guide:

* `200`: Request succeeded for a `GET` call, for a `DELETE` or
  `PATCH` call that completed synchronously, or for a `PUT` call that
  synchronously updated an existing resource
* `201`: Request succeeded for a `POST` call that completed
  synchronously, or for a `PUT` call that synchronously created a new
  resource
* `202`: Request accepted for a `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, or `PATCH` call that
  will be processed asynchronously
* `206`: Request succeeded on `GET`, but only a partial response
  returned: see [above on ranges](#paginate-with-ranges)

Pay attention to the use of authentication and authorization error codes:

* `401 Unauthorized`: Request failed because user is not authenticated
* `403 Forbidden`: Request failed because user does not have authorization to access a specific resource

Return suitable codes to provide additional information when there are errors:

* `422 Unprocessable Entity`: Your request was understood, but contained invalid parameters
* `429 Too Many Requests`: You have been rate-limited, retry later
* `500 Internal Server Error`: Something went wrong on the server, check status site and/or report the issue

Refer to the [HTTP response code spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6)
for guidance on status codes for user error and server error cases.

#### Provide full resources where available

Provide the full resource representation (i.e. the object with all
attributes) whenever possible in the response. Always provide the full
resource on 200 and 201 responses, including `PUT`/`PATCH` and `DELETE`
requests, e.g.:

```bash
$ curl -X DELETE \  
  https://service.com/apps/1f9b/domains/0fd4

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8
...
{
  "created_at": "2012-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "hostname": "subdomain.example.com",
  "id": "01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef",
  "updated_at": "2012-01-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

202 responses will not include the full resource representation,
e.g.:

```bash
$ curl -X DELETE \  
  https://service.com/apps/1f9b/dynos/05bd

HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8
...
{}
```

#### Accept serialized JSON in request bodies

Accept serialized JSON on `PUT`/`PATCH`/`POST` request bodies, either
instead of or in addition to form-encoded data. This creates symmetry
with JSON-serialized response bodies, e.g.:

```bash
$ curl -X POST https://service.com/apps \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"name": "demoapp"}'

{
  "id": "01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef",
  "name": "demoapp",
  "owner": {
    "email": "username@example.com",
    "id": "01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef"
  },
  ...
}
```

#### Use consistent path formats

##### Resource names

Use the plural version of a resource name unless the resource in question is a singleton within the system (for example, in most systems a given user would only ever have one account). This keeps it consistent in the way you refer to particular resources.

##### Actions

Prefer endpoint layouts that donâ€™t need any special actions for
individual resources. In cases where special actions are needed, place
them under a standard `actions` prefix, to clearly delineate them:

```
/resources/:resource/actions/:action
```

e.g.

```
/runs/{run_id}/actions/stop
```

#### Downcase paths and attributes

Use downcased and dash-separated path names, for alignment with
hostnames, e.g:

```
service-api.com/users
service-api.com/app-setups
```

Downcase attributes as well, but use underscore separators so that
attribute names can be typed without quotes in JavaScript, e.g.:

```
service_class: "first"
```

#### Support non-id dereferencing for convenience

In some cases it may be inconvenient for end-users to provide IDs to
identify a resource. For example, a user may think in terms of a Heroku
app name, but that app may be identified by a UUID. In these cases you
may want to accept both an id or name, e.g.:

```bash
$ curl https://service.com/apps/{app_id_or_name}
$ curl https://service.com/apps/97addcf0-c182
$ curl https://service.com/apps/www-prod
```

Do not accept only names to the exclusion of IDs.

#### Minimize path nesting

In data models with nested parent/child resource relationships, paths
may become deeply nested, e.g.:

```
/orgs/{org_id}/apps/{app_id}/dynos/{dyno_id}
```

Limit nesting depth by preferring to locate resources at the root
path. Use nesting to indicate scoped collections. For example, for the
case above where a dyno belongs to an app belongs to an org:

```
/orgs/{org_id}
/orgs/{org_id}/apps
/apps/{app_id}
/apps/{app_id}/dynos
/dynos/{dyno_id}
```
